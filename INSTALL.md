Below is a list of packages that I regularly use, at the moment they are not incorporated into any installation script of any kind. Most of these are for dev experience, and are not related to the required utilities for a project. Those can be installed ad-hoc.

Reason being is that I am currently lazy. I suggest installation through brew: 

stow 
tmux 
carapace 
nvim 
yazi 
eza 
zoxide
